# Components in Block diagram.
## AVR MICROCONTROLLER
 - It contain on chip central processing unit (CPU), Read only memory (ROM), Random access memory (RAM), input/output unit, interrupts controller etc. Therefore a microcontroller is used for high speed signal processing operation inside an embedded system.

## Gas Sensor
 - Gas sensors also known as gas detectors are electronic devices that detect and identify different types of gasses. ... It includes all MQ series gas sensors this module Module can be used to sense Carbon Monoxide and Methane Gas, Hydrogen Gas, etc.

## GSM Module
 - A GSM modem or GSM module is a hardware device that uses GSM mobile telephone technology to provide a data link to a remote network. From the view of the mobile phone network, they are essentially identical to an ordinary mobile phone, including the need for a SIM to identify themselves to the network.

## LED
 - It is a light emitting diode used for the indication.

## Buzzer
 - A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.

## Exhaust Fan
 - They are used to remove the leaked gas out as a safety measure and are basiclly used to cool places that have suddenly become too hot.
