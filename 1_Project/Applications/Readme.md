## Applications
- Unidentifiable gas leaks give rise to explosions that are harmful to the employees working in the hazardous environment. There comes a need to install smart systems to accurately identify combustible, flammable and toxic gases along with detecting oxygen depletion in industry premises for improved safety.
- Especially, in the oil and gas industry where many gaseous products like propane, butane, and hydrogen are manufactured at a greater level. Hence, the chances of gas explosions are higher as these gases are easily combustible in the oxygen-rich environment.
- A human nose has around 400 different types of scent receptors that enable us to smell approx. 1 trillion different odors. But still, most of us cannot identify the type of gas present in the atmosphere. Hence, there are different sensors to measure accurate gas concentration in the atmosphere. Gas detection sensors are most commonly used to develop an IoT-powered system and identify the variation of toxic gases around an industrial facility. It helps benefit the factories and refineries by keeping them safe against any unexpected threats like explosions.
